Dear [HR's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I recently updated my KYC details for my PF account, but I am receiving notifications indicating that the approval is pending from the employer's side for digital signing.

I kindly request you to review and approve the pending KYC update at your earliest convenience to ensure smooth processing. Please let me know if any further action is required from my side.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
